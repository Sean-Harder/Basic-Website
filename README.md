# Basic-Website
 I learned a little bit of HTML and CSS as one of my projects over a 5-6 day break from school.
 This is very, very, very basic, I did this on my school ipad using replit. I think it came out pretty good looking personally but the actual functionaly of the website and how it interacts with is basic, it also isnt dynamic. Maybe in the future I would pick up HTML and CSS again.
